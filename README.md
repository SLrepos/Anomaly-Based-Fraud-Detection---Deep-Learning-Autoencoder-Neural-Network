# 🔍 Anomaly-Based Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoder

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **Deep Learning-based approach** to detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using an **Autoencoder**. The model was trained on the popular [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains anonymized transaction data labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.

By leveraging the **reconstruction error** from an **unsupervised Autoencoder Neural Network** and the power of **Tensorflow**, this approach effectively identifies anomalous patterns indicative of fraud — a common real-world scenario where labeled fraud data is scarce or imbalanced.
